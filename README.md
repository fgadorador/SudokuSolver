# SUDOKU SOLVER GUI PROGRAM PYHTON
---
## The core idea for the program
  1. A window appears asking to fill numbers in grid
  2. A button is pressed to solve the sudoku
  3. The unfilled spaces are filled with the answer

--- 
## Python structure
  1. Main file where all the action is called
  2. A script that handles the creation of the GUI
  3. Transformation script from user input to data and from results
     to output
  4. A script to obtain compute the results

## Roadmap
  1. Make a core desktop program that lets the user input the sudoku and press a button to show the final solution.
  2. Change the input method, from keyboard to image. To do so, image recognition software must be used. 
  3. Modify the program to be used in Android and iOS. 
  4. Give the ability to the user to display each step individually, in order to show the resolution process.

## Libraries proposed
  1. For GUI, learn to use the KIVY library might make this easier with cross plataform later on.
  2. SciPy for the algorithm of solving the sudoku. 
  
## Things to learn with this project
  1. A GUI framework
  2. Python structure
  3. Git (Create a repository in github and make commits)
